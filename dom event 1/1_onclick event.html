        //we can do it in another way as well which is called addEventListener
        let btn = document.getElementById('btn2');
        btn.addEventListener("click",btnClick)//here first we have to mention about the event that is going to happen
        // and the 2nd one the function needs to get activated

        //we can also do this with the help of anonymous function
        // btn.addEventListener('click', function(){
        //     alert('btn was clicked'); //if you want this to work only for one time then you can use anonymous function
        // })
